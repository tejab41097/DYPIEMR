The main task of \'Chemical Engineers\' is to develop economic ways of using materials and energy. A chemical engineer applies the skills of chemistry and engineering to fundamental problems in not just chemical, petrochemical, biochemical and materials processing industries, but also, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and drug delivery systems, semiconductor manufacturing, nanoscale technology, renewable energy, environmental control and many more. Today, the field of chemical engineering is a diverse one, covering areas from biotechnology and nanotechnology to mineral processing. A chemical engineer may be involved in industry or university research where they are tasked in designing and performing experiments to create new and better ways of production, controlling pollution, conserving resources and making these processes safer. They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a project engineer. In this field, the chemical engineer uses their knowledge in selecting plant equipment and the optimum method of production to minimize costs and increase profitability. After its construction, they may help in upgrading its equipment. They may also be involved in its daily operations.</string>
